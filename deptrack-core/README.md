DepTrack
========

DepTrack is a library to let you _compute_ dependency trees/graphs. Rather
than maintaining a graph of dependencies, we propose to _track_ dependencies
as a side-effect of a computation.

Example uses of DepTrack are:

- devops: provision and configure machines
- architecture-documentation: map and describe business processes as dependency graphs
