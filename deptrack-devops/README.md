DepTrack for DevOps
===================

This library provides a node type for DepTrack that contains enough information
to turnup, turndown, and check the healthiness of software entities. This
library also contains functions to operate on the graph of dependency nodes
concurrently (i.e., achieving maximum speed concurrency when turning up/down
dependency graphs).
